# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template


## Notes
- Get the aws cli access creds and export them to env vars
- Had to use `cdk boostrap` from root to be able to deploy
- The deploy worked after that though so idk

## How To Use
- Set AWS creds for programatic access
- `nvm use`
- Boom
